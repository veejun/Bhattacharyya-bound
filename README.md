# Bhattacharyya-bound

Design the Maximum A Posterior (MAP) classifier for the UCI-WINE dataset (3 classes,  13 features), and compute the upper bound of Bayes error (Bhattacharyya bound) or the UCI-WINE dataset.  
Half of the data are used in the training phase, and the rest is for evaluation.  
The dataset is from [WINE_UCI](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine).
